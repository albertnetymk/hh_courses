		The existing Learning Management System (LMS), ``esTracer'', from Entergate company has been updated to be compliant with Sharable Content 
		Object Reference Model (SCORM). By following the SCORM standard, new and existing packages of course materials could be imported and exported 
		to SCORM compliant systems. In the test, one package from ADL is used for importing and presentation. The implementation only applies to 
		``esTracer'' LMS, but the methodology is general and could be used in other LMS as well. This project is implemented using ASP.NET MVC 
		framework. ASP.NET MVC framework is one great framework, which enables developers to stand on a high level to see the whole picture. Future 
		work needs to be done to make ``esTracer'' complete SCORM compliant.
