According to the Linux-Apache-MySOL-PHP(LAMP) server environment, which many Internet Web servers use for hosting online stores, blogs, and applications, we use Apache2(the latest version).

Out of the same reason, we choose to use PHP.

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
We used MPD\&MPC to play the songs because it is much more effective than mpg321. Itâ€™s difficult to make use of the control operation (play, pause, forward) in the case of mpg321.
