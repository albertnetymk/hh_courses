\section*{Conclusion}
We implement a script which will take the input from the user either through keyboard or from the drop-down list, and the following can be the extensions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
A forum can be created using this project and the clients can send their profiles or requests to the server. All users' profiles and passwords(encrypted) will be stored in a database created in the server. Users of this forum could have easy access to their own account and customise what songs will appear in their drop down list.
\item
This project gives one simple but non-trivial illustration of remote control. This could be extended to all kinds of tasks by adding corresponding task-listener in server. This will be much more convenient and could save administrators' time and all kinds of expenditure on transportation.
