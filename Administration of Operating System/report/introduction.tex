\section*{Introduction}
Clients and server will interact with each other via a particular web page.

On this web page, there are two forms. One is a text-box and the other is a drop-down list. After receiving the name of a song, server appends it to a list(the list is achieved using queue data structure in the fashion of FIFO), and shows the client what he or she chose.

Every one minute, the server retrieves the first song from the list, plays it and removes it until it reaches the end of the list.
