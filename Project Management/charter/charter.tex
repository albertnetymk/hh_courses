	Background(original idea) & \multicolumn{6}{p{9cm} |}{Only a tiny fraction of Toyota owners have experienced problems with a sticky accelerator, 
	but recent gas-pedal and brake recalls are having a considerable impact on the company's sales and reputation. 

	A series of surveys suggests Toyota has fallen sharply in customer esteem.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	In a Kelley Blue Book survey released last month, Toyota fell from No. 1 in customer loyalty to No. 3.
	Hyundai moved into the top spot, while Honda held steady in second place.
	\item
	Toyota recently dropped from No. 1 to No. 6 in a "perceived quality" study by Automotive Lease Guide.
	\item
	In a March Bloomberg poll, 4 in 10 Americans said they "would definitely not buy a Toyota." 
	Although nearly half of respondents said they have a favorable impression of Toyota, 36 percent don't. 
	That was the highest negative rating among all automakers in the survey.
