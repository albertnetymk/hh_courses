	Background \\
	\\
	A series of surveys suggests Toyota has fallen sharply in customer esteem.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		In a Kelley Blue Book survey released last month, Toyota fell from No.1 in customer loyalty to No.3. Hyundai moved into the top spot, while 
		Honda held steady in second place.
		\item
		Toyota recently dropped from No. 1 to No. 6 in a "perceived quality" study by Automotive Lease Guide.
		\item
		In a March Bloomberg poll, 4 in 10 Americans said they "would definitely not buy a Toyota." Although nearly half of respondents said they have 
		a favorable impression of Toyota, 36 percent don't. That was the highest negative rating among all automakers in the survey.
		\end{itemize}
		\\

	\hline
		Objective \\
		\\
		To improve image of Toyota, regain the confidence from customers. \\
	
	\hline
		Goal \\
		\\
		To keep the market share. \\

	\hline
		Limitation \\
		\\
		The loss of this accident will be delivered in the project report. The share of market is nor promised after the promotion period is over. \\
