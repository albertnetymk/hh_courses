\section{Problem 1}
Enum.valueof will throw one IllegalArgument exception, and this exception is caught in the code, and print``Sorry, no command''.

The size is 100, and the initial value is zero. In the beginning, where we declare the size and the array. We use Array.toString() to print the array.

Sometimes, it fails to find the element. We use binarySearch() to find the element, while binary search can only be used for sorted array.

Without the break statement, it will just continue execute the next case.

\section{Problem 4}
String is immutable, for immutable is generally easier to use and there are no obvious reasons to make them mutable.

Integer is immutable, for it makes sense that one number does not change.

StringBuffer is mutable, for it does not create temporary strings, if we need to construct one string using several steps.

List is mutable, for it acts as one container, and its state will change as its content changes.
