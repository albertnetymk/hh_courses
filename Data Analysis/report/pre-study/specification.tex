	Background \\ [1ex]
	Large quantities of paper are produced and shipped every day at a paper mill. Several trucks are involved to handle all these materials.

	The situation is explained subsequently:
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item
		Paper reels are produced and coming out on a conveyor belt.
	    \item
		From conveyor belt they are transported to intermediate storage or to immediate shipping area.
	    \item
		From intermediate storage they are later transported to shipping area(container, train, lorry).
	\end{enumerate}
	\\ [-2ex] \hline \\ [-2ex]

	Objective \\ [1ex]
	To develop a presenting and simulation environment to test techniques that can be used optimize the material handling. \\
	\\ [-2ex] \hline \\ [-2ex]

	Goal \\ [1ex]
	To convey information from the database, in order to do the further optimization.\\
	\\ [-2ex] \hline \\ [-2ex]

	Limitation
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item
		Possible optimization approach will not be proposed or simulated.
	    \item
		The NEWWHLOCCODE or OLDWHLOCCODE of data have to be among the 180 places, otherwise we will not process them.
	    \item
		The reel damaging reason is not presented.
	    \item
		The factory map will not be exactly presented, for we are just trying to convey the tracks of trucks. How the factory is constructed is not
		the point. Therefore, we will simplify the process by plotting each cell as one cell.
	    \item
		The distance will be presented with center meter precision.
	\end{enumerate} \\ \hline

    \begin{tabular}{| p{14.5cm} |}
	\hline \\ [0.5ex]
	Product requirement
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item
		The situation expressed in the form of database is presented in the form that is easily understandable for human.
	\end{itemize}
	\\ [-2ex] \hline \\ [-2ex]
	Project requirement
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item
		The simulation environment must have the ability to present the user with the total distance based on each truck and all trucks.
	    \item
		The simulation environment must have the information based on each reel, such as the total transported distance, the number of
		movement before it is shipped out, the period of time it spends inside factory.
	    \item
		The simulation environment must have the information concerning the usage of all cells with the passage of time.
	    \item
		The simulation environment must have the ability to illustrate the trucks' path.
	    \item
		The simulation environment must have a graphic interface to illustrate the above information.
	    \item
		The simulation environment must keep track of the damaging of reels, such as when the reel was damaged.
	    \item
		As for the WHLOCCODE is one capital letter, the simulation software could have the ability to seek the really location by
		referencing other reels, that share the same order code as this one.
	    \item
		The simulation environment could have the ability to present the statistic information of the above variables, such as  total
		transported distance, the number of movement, etc.
	    \item
		More is coming.
	\end{itemize}
	\\ [-2ex] \hline \\ [-2ex]
	Prerequisites
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item
		The information about StoraEnso production system database, such as how the data is gathered, and the platform this database is using.
	    \item
		Periodic reference must be provided during the execution of this project.
