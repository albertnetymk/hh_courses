Accept method summarise the interface of abstract syntax class, so we don't need to care which particular Exp we are dealing with. 

We leave it to the compiler to figure it out why class it really is, for Exp is an abstract class.

If we choose to not use accept method, we will end up pre-knowing the subclass of Exp, before we visit the parse tree, which is not possible.
